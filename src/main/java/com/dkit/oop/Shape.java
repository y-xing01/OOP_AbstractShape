// Abstract class
// - if a class defines one or more abstract methods then
//   the class must be declared as abstract (as in this example)
// - an abstract class can NOT be instantiated (i.e. it is not
//   possible to create an object of the class using 'new ClassName()'
// - subclasses MUST implement all abstract methods e.g. getArea()
//   (the compiler will indicate an error if a subclass does not
//   implement a method that has been declared as 'abstract'
//   (So, writers of subclasses are forced to implement all methods)
//
// - the area() method is declared as "abstract", so developers who
//   extend this class must implement an area() method. We want to
//   be able to get the area() of all shape objects.


// Shape class
// A drawing package needs to represent shape objects (Rectangles, Circles, etc)
// All shape objects must have a position, an (x,y) co-ordinate that represents
// the top left corner of the object's position (bounding rectangle).
// All shapes must provide an area() method.
// Therefore, we choose to define a ABSTRACT area() method,
// and consequently, we must define the Shape class as ABSTRACT also.
